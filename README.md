# Chicory: A Colorful Tale level screenshots

These original in-game level screenshots are used for the [Chicory: A Colorful Data](https://github.com/chicory-pizza/chicory-data) level editor project.

Committing large images to a Git repo is not really a good idea, hence the images are hosted in a separate Git repo to reduce disk space (200+ MB) for that project, especially for contributors that don’t need to change any of the images.

These images are rehosted through Cloudflare CDN on `https://temple.chicory.pizza/level_screenshots/{level_id}.png`

## How to screenshot

The game itself has a built-in mass-screenshot tool by enabling debug mode using [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool) and pressing `Ctrl-Q`, this loads all levels and save screenshots to `%localappdata%\paintdog\working\level_screens\`

Some levels need some reworking to do such as annoying paint splashes in the water or the boss not appearing.

## License

If you’re writing a guide or building something for the game, feel free to reuse these images. Technically, all the graphics are from the game, so I don’t feel it’s appropriate to put a license in this repo.
